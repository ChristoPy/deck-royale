# deck-royale
An application to generate Clash Royale Decks and more!

## Project information
It is a fork. The modified things where:
1. Layout
2. Colors
3. Removed Bootstrap
4. Updated the project to the Vue CLI 3 main template

The usage is simple and it is meant to be used as a Progressive Web Application as well.
I tried to make the styling more faithfull to the mockups.

## Known bugs
The data is rendered on Deck view but not shown (trying to solve it until now)

### How to use it?
Just clone and install with:
```
npm install
```

After installed all dependencies, just start the development server with:
```
npm run serve
```

And to build for production:
```
npm run build
```
